As the name suggests, we visit the Observatory located in the Airstrip, conduct night sky observations and take images using the 14’’ telescope of the Observatory. 
OAAR stands for Observatory Automation for Astronomical Research, i.e., aiming to fully automate the Observatory, being able to operate that from the clubroom itself, using our PCs, which is also the long-term goal of the project. 
To achieve the objectives, we learn basic introduction to telescope handling and understanding the stellar movements, capturing deep sky objects (Astrophotography) from the observatory telescope as well as with our own phones, 
understand the function of the various circuits and sensors present in the Observatory using softwares like Arduino (even making our own raindrop sensor!), 
discovering weather mointoring using APIs and Jupyter Notebooks, 
learning and understanding the functions of various softwares (PHD2 Guiding, ASCOM Standard, FocusMax, Celestron CPWI, Autofocuser) used in the Observatory and how they control the hardware like the 14’’ telescope, starshoot autoguider, monoculars etc., 
simulate star systems using Universal Sandbox and MATLAB, making simulation models and doing a comparative study from the observational data (vs simulated data).
